# shopEcomm

Outline: shopEcomm is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using React + Django. This project has a fully fledged admin panel that makes the management of users,
products, and orders across the platform easy. Paypal/CC integration has been implemented to provide customers with a quick and reliable way to pay for their orders in addition to the
secure user registration/authentication features. Track and view your orders from your profile and update account information if necessary.
